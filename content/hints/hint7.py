'''
1 is the correct first digit

Group 1's pin guesses are all less than the correct guess

Group 2's pin guesses are all greater than the correct pin

We might assume that this pattern will hold for future pin digits, which would mean character
guesses lower than the correct digit will result in a dipping trace while character guesses
higher than the correct digit will result in a rising trace. This might suggest that the second
digit is higher than 0, since the trace for 1000 dips after 940 similar to group 1 earlier.
